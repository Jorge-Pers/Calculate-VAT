# Calculate-VAT - OOP

With this script we have the possibility to calculate
VAT, Gross and Net amount, using OOP.

- Before running the script is good to know which VAT RATE is needed.
   I set up VatRate = 20 by the fault however can be changed. 
   
- The user  will enter the amount and the program will provide:
* VAT 
* Gross amount
* Net amount.
